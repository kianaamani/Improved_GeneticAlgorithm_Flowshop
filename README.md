Hi!

In the present repository, you will find two files available. 

One is the paper titled "An Improved Genetic Algorithm for the Flowshop Scheduling Problem," while the other contains the code implementing an enhanced genetic algorithm based on this paper. 

I trust this clarifies the contents for you. 

Should you have any further inquiries, please feel free to reach out to me at kianaamany@gmail.com.
